# Gamified Misinformation Intervention

This repository contains materials and data related to a research project on designing and evaluating a gamified intervention to combat misinformation. The intervention uses storytelling, socio-psychological priming, and media literacy techniques to improve users' ability to identify and resist misinformation.

## Files

### 1. `Pilot Study Data.xlsx`
- **Description**: Contains the data collected during the pilot study. This data includes baseline responses, responses after socio-psychological priming, and responses following media literacy interventions.
- **Purpose**: To analyze and evaluate the effectiveness of the gamified intervention across different stages.

### 2. `Treatment & Control Stimuli_News Items.docx`
- **Description**: Includes the narratives and stimuli used in the intervention. These news items are categorized into:
  - **Text-Based News**: With varying levels of veracity (true or false).
  - **Audio DeepFakes**: Synthesized audio clips used to test misinformation discernment.
- **Purpose**: To provide a clear structure of the experimental stimuli used in the treatment and control groups across three stages:
  - **Baseline Stage**
  - **After Socio-Psychological Priming**
  - **After Media Literacy Intervention**

## Purpose of the Repository
This repository is designed to support the development and evaluation of gamified misinformation interventions. It includes:
- Data to evaluate the impact of the intervention on participants' ability to identify true vs. false information.
- Stimuli to replicate or extend the research in future studies.

## Usage
- **Pilot Study Data**: Use `Pilot Study Data.xlsx` to perform statistical analyses and assess the intervention's effectiveness.
- **Narratives and Stimuli**: Refer to `Treatment & Control Stimuli_News Items.docx` for the experimental content used during the study.

## Research Process
1. **Baseline Stage**:
   - Participants evaluated their ability to discern true and false information without any prior intervention.
2. **Socio-Psychological Priming**:
   - Participants were exposed to narrative frameworks aimed at reducing susceptibility to misinformation.
3. **Media Literacy Intervention**:
   - Participants received targeted tips and strategies to improve critical thinking and identify fake news.
